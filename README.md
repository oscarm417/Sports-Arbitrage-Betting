# Sports-Arbitrage-Betting
Finds all betting arbitrage opportunities across all major sports betting companies. Currently only a report of the bets is outputted. Future projects consists of automatically sending the orders to the corresponding exchange.  Another future improvement is adjusting the bet sizes to hide arbitrage behavior. For example, putting a bet size of 89.72 is very odd, so we will have to round up or find a multiplier that makes it a round number, which ever has less of an impact on the final profit.
